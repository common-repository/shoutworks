= The Shoutworks Story =
We believe that when your community is stronger, your business is, too. That's why we set out to make Shoutworks.

When we got started, it was common for big brands to hire expensive developers to build Alexa skills that could help them stay close to their customers. On the other hand, we saw smart developers growing to massive success with their Alexa skills - getting 6,000+ leads a day and making $10,000+ a month from Alexa alone.

We thought: With over 4 billion Alexa-ready devices, why weren't more entrepreneurs and business owners getting in on this massive opportunity? Then we realized: The technology was too hard and too expensive. So we decided to do something about it.

We think driven entrepreneurs like you and me should get the same opportunities as the big brands, without having to spend thousands. You shouldn't have to be a programmer to create for Alexa's massive platform - that would be like making Facebook or YouTube exclusive to developers. That's not just silly, it's unfair.

So we've taken those tools and made them incredibly easy for anyone to use, no matter your skill set. With Shoutworks, you can now leverage Alexa to get closer to your community just as well as (or better than!) the best brands in the world.

Ultimately, our goal is to help you rise above the noise, grow the business you want, and achieve the freedom you deserve.

I would love to have you share and learn with [our community of forward-thinking entrepreneurs and business owners growing with voice](https://www.facebook.com/groups/shoutworks.voice.marketing.and.growth).

Yours Vocally,
Christian Petroske
Co-Founder, Shoutworks
